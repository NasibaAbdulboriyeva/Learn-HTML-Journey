# 🌍 HTML Journey

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **HTML and CSS**.  
Here I keep my practice files, small projects, and experiments while improving my web development skills.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen the basics of HTML and CSS  
- Learn by building small projects  
- Track my progress over time  

## 📂 Structure
Each folder or file represents a project or exercise I have completed.  
For example:  
- `social-links-profile/` → a profile card project  
- `recipe-page/` → a recipe page project  

## 📚 Resources I Use
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) – documentation and guides
